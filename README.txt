I'm starting a new project nammed Screwdriver, an experimental level editor inspired by Valve's Hammer Editor. It is being developed for Linux using raylib and written entirely in C. This project is in early development and not yet functional. The goal is to create a modern, Linux-native alternative to Hammer that supports real-time editing and testing without relying on a source engine install. Screwdriver is not a replacement for the Hammer Editor. It's simply an alternative for users who prefer a different workflow, especially those on Linux.

The editor will use a modal interface (similar to VI), with separate modes for tasks like navigation, editing, and testing.

PLANNED FEATURES
    * Modal interface inspired by vim

    * Real-time lighting simulation

    * Real-time sound system

    * "Test mode" to walk through maps without launching a separate game

    * Grid snapping, brush/entity placement

    * Camera controls and 3D viewports

DEPENDENCIES
    * raylib

    * C compiler (gcc, clang, etc.)

    * make
